        "content": "\nArrival:Product arrived in perfect condition.Assembly:The only assembly needed was to bolt the back of the chair onto the base of the chair using 4 very sturdy bolts.  Unlike other office chairs the bolts screw in from the back, not the sides which helps to give the chair a very solid feeling when sitting in it.  The lumbar support was already in place and just needed to be adjusted to my liking after assembly.Adjustment:The chair has a variety of adjustments available.  Two of them are for limiting the chair's movement when leaning back or forward.  This has come in handy a few times but mostly I tend to let the chair have full movement which helps it to support me while I adjust position throughout the day.  One of the other adjustments is height.  The height adjustment pneumatic seems a little bit more sturdy than other chairs I've had so I hope it lasts longer as that's usually the thing that goes out first.  The last adjustment is the tension control.  This is probably the most important adjustment.  When you first get the chair it's action is very 'loose' and you need to adjust the tension enough to support you without being too tense.  It took a couple days of adjusting this slightly to get it to a point that feels good and gives me just enough support without having too much.  After getting this adjusted correctly the chair was much more comfortable than when I took it out of the box.  There are videos on the company web site that show you how to adjust everything and what it does.Quality:The chair is very high quality.  The only thing that even slightly annoys me is that the arm rests can be bumped which then causes them to move from side to side.  I would prefer if that was something that could be set and then held in place a little more rigidly.  The mesh seat and back is very comfortable and adjusts to your body.  I'm 6 foot tall and 220 pounds and the chair supports me perfectly.  The plastic frame is a very sturdy plastic that does not warp or bend in any way even during intense sessions of on-line gaming where I tend to move around a bit.Over all:I used to slump in my chairs with my bottom out toward the edge and my back curved.  This would cause me some pain and discomfort throughout the day.  This chair helps me be comfortable while sitting in it properly which has helped my back immensely.  Combine that with the long period of customer support and this chair is worth the money.\n",

        "content": "\nI have owned Herman Miller Classic Aeron chairs for decades and am quite familiar with how they function and what to expect \u2013 it is a wonderful product!THE PURCHASE:While making seating adjustments to my new Herman Miller chair from InscapeModern, I heard mechanical noises coming from under the seat, this is not normal and I began to sense the chair, which was sold as new, might be second hand, defective and possibly unsafe.The fashion with which this chair was packaged was far from professional. Two casters were busting out of the undersized cardboard box - if I had been present when the package was delivered, I would never have accepted it. Also, due to insufficient packaging around the chair itself, cardboard burns (cardboard rubbing up against the product during shipping) were noticeable. At this point, I was very disappointed with product, packaging, and shipping. Keep in mind, this is not an Office Depot, run of the mill office chair, this is a Herman Miller worth $800!I requested a full refund.InscapeModern was willing to offer me technical assistance and $50 compensation \u2013 really! InscapeModern also offered a refund if they found the chair undamaged by me. Did they not read the aforementioned?THE RETURN PROCESS:12/5/23: I returned the chair in the same box and same packaging as I received it. Note: I live in a condo complex with a common delivery area for packages. I could not leave the item in the common area for random FedEx pickup, as you never know if a thief might be lurking about, especially during the Christmas season. So, I located a dolly and strolled the package several blocks for drop-off at the local Postal Annex. BTW, I do not own a vehicle that could transport an item of that size.12/7/23: I receive a notice that FedEx is returning the chair back to me. Yes, after all that, the chair is on its way back to me - nothing I can do at this point. Imagine my surprise when I open the box only to find a completely different chair, a chair of much less value.  Wait, it gets better!A few days later, I am back in the delivery area searching through new packages and come across a box with my name on it. InscapeModern had returned my original chair! NOW I POSSESS 2 UNWANTED CHAIRS!12/13/23: After going back and forth with InscapeModern, their shipping department sends me 2 return labels with the information that FedEx will pick up both chairs by end of day, Friday the 15th.12/15/23: With high expectation of finalizing this debacle, I sat around all day waiting for the pick-up that may be as late as 10PM. FedEx never showed.12/16/23: Next day, InscapeModern sends me a message stating that \u201cFedEx did not come to their facility yesterday and will try to come today or possibly Monday for pick up.\u201d WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!?  Why would FedEx need to go to their facility to be notified of a scheduled pickup in San Diego? This whole thing is beginning to smell of either scam or idiocy.12/18/23: Boxes scheduled for the 20th were picked up on the 18th. Glad someone was home.Note: InscapeModern shipping never once asked which days I might be available for a Fed Ex pick-up. Did it never occur to the InscapeModern shipping dept. that people have to work and might not be available?I know this review is lengthy, but it is honest and true, and worth the time it took to write it. I simply want to caution anyone else from undergoing the awful experience I had with InscapeModern.In the end, InscapeModern did give me the full refund.Thanks for reading.\n",

        "content": "\nI'm a firm believer in the old saying \"you get what you pay for.\"  I'm sure there are plenty of exceptions out there, but for the most part, you can't expect to get top quality, top comfort, and top notch warranties at a bargain basement price.For less than $900, the Aeron chair I bought is far from the most expensive office chair out there, but few would call it cheap.  Still, this IS a bargain.  It comes with the Herman Miller 10+ year warranty, it's made of very high quality, durable materials, and it looks great.At 6'1\", 270#, I'm not a small guy (a bit of a bear actually :).  The size C is plenty large, however, and the whole chair feels rock solid even under my weight.  I upgraded to the Wave fabric and am quite glad I did.  I have the percale on my Aeron at work, and while it's comfortable, it seems a bit too firm at times.  The wave fabric is both supportive and a bit more flexible.  It seems to form to the shape of my body more than the percale.  It's also supposed to be a bit more durable.All of that said, a $200 OfficeMax chair may be better for you if the Aeron isn't comfortable for you.  The most expensive furniture, or any product, is worthless if it isn't right for you.  SIT IN THE CHAIR BEFORE YOU BUY!  I'm always surprised by the reviews claiming a chair is \"a rip off\" or \"not worth it\" because it turns out to be uncomfortable.  Is a shoe a rip off because it doesn't fit your foot properly?  Of course not, it's just not right for your body.  The same goes for chairs, particularly ones you may be using 10 or 12 hours a day.  Find a local retailer and sit in one of these before you spend $900 on it folks.  Some of you will find it as perfect and delightful as I do.  Others will find the chair doesn't fit right or feel right.I hope at least some of you find this helpful.  I really like the chair and would recommend it to anyone.\n",

        "title": "TLDR: Very comfortable, solid construction works great on carpeted floors.",
        "content": "\nReviewing the Aeron Chair by Herman MillerDuration of ownership - 1 MonthTLDR: Very comfortable, solid construction works great on carpeted floors.I've gone through several computer chairs over the years, most of which use the arms of the chair to secure the backrest.  This can be problematic, as I've run into many times, the arms break or become loose and the back of the chair becomes unstable.  This tends to end up in a downward spiral with a broken chair.  The other issue I run into is with the base of the chair, many are made of plastic and as you roll on the carpet the plastic holding the wheels together tends to give out.  Both situations have ended with me on the floor looking up at my computer desk.The Aeron chair is one I've had the pleasure of testing in the office many times in the past, however the price always kept me from buying one.  Well no longer!  I finally decided that I would spend the money up front rather than going through cheep chairs bought from the likes of Staples Best Buy and Office Space...Assembly was a matter of attaching 4 bolts, couldn't have been easier!Overall it has been glorious!  The mesh seat (or Butt Hammock as I like to call it) never gets uncomfortable and doesn't get hot after a while like leather. The adjustable arms let me quickly move them from in use to out of the way, the metal base and wheels roll over the carpet with ease.If I had any complaints it would be that I didn't buy one sooner.One Tip: The front of the seat has a rubber pad and a hard plastic lip.  If the chair isn't configured right this can be most uncomfortable.  In fact of those that tried my chair that's what they have complained about.  However a quick adjustment or two later that complaint went away.  The trick is to ensure that the seat is set so your thighs are parallel to the floor while at rest (using the height adjustment and the front angle adjustment) and that the seat isn't too far forward.I don't expect my review to change as I've used this chair type at work for many years and had no problems.\n",

        "content": "\nI received this chair today within the estimated range of delivery dates. It came in a large box which fit through the front door but was on the heavy side and too large for me to pick up myself. The chair in two pieces -- the back was wrapped in plastic separate from the seat and base. Directions for how to adjust the chair were attached to the base along with an allen wrench. Both pieces were wrapped in heavy duty bubble wrap. It took me 10 minutes max to open the box, use the allen wrench to remove the 4 large screws in the back of the base and attach the chair back. The directions for how to adjust the chair were very straightforward and easy to understand. As this chair isn't classified as \"new\" I made a note of anything that appeared worn. There are what appear to be strapping marks across both arms and because there was no strapping in the packaging, I can only assume this may have been from previous packaging. Please see included photos. Also, bear in mind the reflection is making the marks stand out. Minus the bright light, they're unnoticeable. No matter. The chair is fabulous, works perfectly and feels SO much better than what I have been accustomed to. What a deal!\n",

There are actual chunks missing from the plastic as if someone took a power tool to it.The gouge lines also travel through the padding under the seat, which is gashed and sheds foam everywhere when touched.The plastic housing that holds the mechanical internals is deformed with cuts that go all the way through the plastic. It is so deformed that the top and bottom pieces do not even fit together, impossible to miss visually.The very bottom of the center post is missing a cap, so it got grease on my carpet.The levers that adjust the chair do not function.IT DOES NOT HAVE THE PROMISED WARRANTY STICKER.The back is \"like-new\", they obviously took a completely totaled chair that had been attacked with power tools, threw a a used back on it, and called it good.\n",

        "content": "\nI am fortunate enough to work from home, and I have tried a variety of chairs. This one blows them all away, and I'm only left to wonder why I waited so long. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse, a refurbished chair. There was a small mark/scratch on the left arm rest, but other than that, the chair looked and smelled new. It came in two pieces, with 4-6 bolts and a hex key. No instructions were included at all, perhaps this is because it wasn't a brand new chair. I didn't have any issues, though, and had the chair assembled in about 15 minutes.I did download the adjustment instructions directly from the Herman Miller website, although before I did that, I played around and found a comfortable adjustment. I did look over the instructions just in case I was missing anything.The chair is so comfortable! My favorite part is when you go to stand, the chair helps lift you out and stays in an upright position until you sit down. So if you walked in and looked at the chair, you'd think it might be uncomfortably rigid, as it sits upright more than you'd imagine. But once you sit down, it yields and is far superior to any other office chair (at least that I've ever used/owned.)It is very easy to adjust, very easy to assemble, and is extremely comfortable. The only downside is the price, but everyone looking at a Herman Miller chair knows about its price going in.I would highly recommend this chair!\n",

At 1/2 price, be sure to order the Opttico Office Chair Caster Wheels Replacement Set of 5 - Black 3\" HARDWOOD FLOOR Chair Wheels - No Chair Mat Needed - Roller Blade Style HEAVY DUTY Desk Chair Casters With Soft Rubber Wheels, Smooth & Silent to really make this chair right. IMHO These seem like a good deal, 1/2 off retail. Now months later I realize that these chairs or at least the one the grabbed and sent to me is worn out just to the brink of being noticeable. Finally the latch to raise and lower the hydraulic cylinder, the little special plastic part of the chair snapped off. This symptom was every time I came back to the chair it had risen to the top of it's height and would not hold the sitting height I last set it at. After watching many how to adjust and then trouble shoot and repair these chairs I found how and where to buy the pre ready kit, cause they know it's weak. So add another 60 bucks and you have to practically take the whole chair apart to fix a weak plastic part that is held in with one tiny screw. So needless to say after 500 bucks I am back in my $99 Amazon office chair that both arms can be moved out of the way for tasks. When I can afford to buy the parts and then dig in and repair / replace it I might have my HM chair back at my desk again. If you are going to buy one of these used, try to go and inspect it. These chairs come in 2 parts in a 50lb box no assembly require so DO NOT PAY FOR ASSEMBLY! My cat could do it. If you live in any major city search these out at office furniture resale outlets, they have hundreds of them and with a little kindness perhaps they would help you pick out one that doesn't have one of the 1/2 dozen major over use issues. I live 1.5 hrs going 80 mph from Sacramento, Ca so it would take a day to do it right. They got me. I love Amazon but every once in a while things get squirrelly. This is one of them and it isn't inexpensive in any way. Also these are a major dust magnet and have many nooks and crannies that are near impossible to get to. Take it out in the drive way and use a leaf blower to start, seriously, then dust off and brushes and do it about every 60 days, just like a computer keyboard.\n",

That means I get to sit in front of a computer at least 8-9 hours a day, sometimes more then 24 hours straight if I have deadlines to meet. I am also a large person, 270+ lbs. No other chair I have ever owned has felt right for me. Most chairs I have used have broken 7-8 months after purchase. Either the main support system cracks, the armrests break off from the back of the chair, or the gas piston falls through the base of the chair when I accidentally sit down on it to fast after 8+ hours of solid work and just one break. This chair is completely different then any other chair I have owned. The base is solid metal, so no breakage possible there. The arms are attached to the structural base of the chair, not the back, and they are independent of the structural integrity of the chair as a whole. The back is attached to the base with oversized hex screws that feel more solid then some welding work I have seen. What little plastic is on the chair is the most rigid I have ever seen, it seems stronger than ABS plastic. The best part however is the actual chair \"cushions\". The material is less than 3mm thick and it's a mesh weave not an actual cushion, but it feels better than 6 inches of memory foam. Not to mention the seating area is suspended above the structural base like a truck is suspended above it's tires. This is as much of a work of art as it is mechanical marvel. Nothing else even comes close. Is it worth $880? That depends on how much you value your comfort while working and how often you want to replace your chair if you are prone to breaking them for whatever reason. With a 100% 12 year, 3 shift warranty (described as three 8 hour shifts -back to back- per day, totaling 24 hours a day of use), I will actually save $1500 in the next 12 years on replacing subpar chairs alone. These chairs hold their value over time too, most used Aeron chairs go for $450-$500 even after 8+ years of use. To me it's a no brainer. I demand the best quality for and out of my work. That means I also demand the best tools to get the job done and keep my competitive edge. If you are a professional that sits at a desk all day, the Aeron chair is seating nirvana.\n",

        "content": "\nThe Aeron chair is supposed to be the state of the art in seating, It is. It's why people would pay $950+ for a desk chair when Amazon Basics sells a similar-looking one for $130. I bought this chair because (1) my old chair, which was surplus'd from a previous employer 20 years ago, was falling to bits, (2) because I'd set in Aeron chairs at work and they were comfortable, and (3) I'd hurt my lower back, and my old chair was making it worse.I bought the C size, because I'm 6'2\" and 240lbs. It is wide enough, but not too wide. I like the lumbar support. The chairs I used at work didn't have 'em. I also like the ability to tilt the front of the chair down when you need to sit forward at your desk, like for building things. You can buy Aeron-branded chairs for $75 less if you give up all the adjustability, but if you're going to cheap out, might as well buy the Amazon Basics chair.Even the unboxing experience was ergonomic. Remove the shipping straps. Pull the top off. Pull the sides straight up. No lifting. You have only to assemble the back onto the chair with four big bolts. An Allen key is included. The unboxing and assembly went very smoothly and took less than 5 minutes. There's no way to make a mistake. A chimp could do it. Ooh Ooooh!The armrests swivel in and out, whether you want them to or not. This is just a bit annoying, and might trigger your OCD if you want them to stay. The frame of the chair is molded. The mold left sharp edges where halves of the frame join. There are also sharp edges around the screws that hold the frame together. I can probably sand the sharp edges off. These are pretty minor complaints.\n",

And the Herman Miller Aeron chairs I sat in at client sites never blew me away.  They always felt to small.  After doing some research I discovered that Herman Miller makes three different sizes of chair A=small, B=intermediate, and C=Large.  So based upon all the positive buzz around this chair, and advice provided by my chiropractor, I took a chance and bought the biggest size (C) - I am 6'1\" and 210.  I made a good decision.It is not the type of chair that you sit in and go aaahh. Not plushy, and soft, and oversized.  But after sitting in it for 2-3 days, up to 8-10 hours a day, I noticed that my back was not stiff, my legs not stiff and crampy.  I also purchased the aftermarket headrest on Amazon (not a Herman Miller product, but still great quality) and that made the chair even better.  It is incredibly comfortable and highly adjustable (spend the extra dollars and purchase the fully loaded Aeron chair so you get all the adjustment options).  I saved big by purchasing the chair on Amazon as compared to other retailers who charge up to twice as much.  Plus you get the full 12 year warranty from Herman Miller.  I found it about $100 cheaper from an online retailer, but it only had a 30 day warranty.I have been seeing a chiropractor for the last 10 years to straighten me out from nearly 20 years of spinal abuse from playing football and rugby.  This chair has absolutely helped in this regard.  He noticed that I have been holding my adjustments better, and we both attribute it to the herman Miller Aeron chair.\n",

I bought it after weeks of on and off searching and finding reviews that made reference to another saying \"...chair X is good, of course of course it isn't a 'Hon'.\" Finally I checked a 'Hon' site and found reviews that said it \"...was a real good chair, but of course it was not a Aeron.\" And, as I said, I knew of Aeron - and that is was not $300 like so many other chairs I have prematurely sent to Goodwill in the last few decades. SO I decided, at last, to get one in a color to fit my den .My only complaint is that the lumbar adjustment device, partly because of its range of adjustment that you have to like, tends to ride up and out of its guide channels on each side; but is a simple a matter to put it back so I can forgive a minor annoyance. On the color I must note that this vendor did not deliver. The chair that arrived was stock gray, but Amazon made a more than fair price adjustment, so I am OK with it and just keep the light low - hey it IS a den.\n",

        "content": "\nI had this Herman Miller Aeron Chair on my list for a couple of years just monitoring prices and feedback.  I finally purchased while it was on sale.  I'm very pleased.  It is a very nice chair.  The lack of a seat cushion was a little concerning from pictures, but, the netting system is very deceptively comfortable.  After spending most of the last 8 days in this Aeron chair, I have to confess I'm sorry I waited so long.  I replaced a 13 year old no-name chair from that Big Box store whose cushion failed 5 years ago.  And honestly after the sale price, the Aeron wasn't that much more expensive.  Others have seriously good advice about trying a chair before you buy it but if you're like me in the Midwest, NO one carries it locally.  With no hassle returns, it wasn't much of a risk for me to buy to try it.  The lumbar support on this chair is pretty nice.  I've not had a lumbar support before, but I'm impressed at how much longer I can sit comfortably and not have upper back pains.  I have no regrets buying this.  My singular niggle is simply the Recline lock that keeps the back from reclining on my chair seems to slip out occasionally.  This may be a QC issue and its very minor.  I seem to have to flip it back into position once or twice a day randomly.  If you're looking anywhere near this price range, you definitely owe it to your backside to give this chair a serious look.\n",

Many of the ~250 chairs at work are Aeron chairs, some in use nearly 24/7 by rotating shifts of essential personnel.  They handle constant use well, with few breakages (a few have a missing arm or some other fault).  Each chair comes with an excellent warranty, though I have no idea if my office utilizes it.I work in an enterprise IT environment, and spend much of my work day sitting.  Even at the end of a 12+ hour shift I'm not sore, sweaty, or particularly uncomfortable.  I fell at the edge of medium and large on the sizing chart, so I went with the large size.  The seat on the large is a little wider than I need, but the bit of extra length makes reclining very comfortable.The chair comes in several pieces, and is easy to assemble (no additional tools required).  Adjusting the overall height, arm height, or pressure required to lean back are simple.  I don't use the lumbar support, as I find it more comfortable without it.I ordered my Aeron chair through Backstore, who I communicated with regarding shipping (only option for receiving address was 2-4 week via USPS).  They responded quickly to my replies, and were very professional.  They also contacted me later to check if I had received the chair.  Were I to order additional office equipment offered via Backstore, I would definitely work with them again.\n",

As an actual bonus, the padding on the arms is *nicer* than my work Aeron: it's squishier and less like shiny/hard foam.  It's used, so what.  I feel like I could sit in the one at work another 8 years if I cared to.Since no one ever takes the photos that let you see the dang thing, what we have here are photos of every piece of the thing, from assembly through to the lumbar doodad.Shipping was fine: I think it actually arrived early.  Assembly is trivial: insert the back and use the provided hex wrench to secure it.  Done.\n",

The Herman Miller 10 year warranty is not supported when you buy your HM seats from Madison.Seating.  My seat bottom broke after less than two years, and now we have to pay Herman Miller more than $100 to replace it, since Madison.Seating will not help us at all.  They do not stand behind their products, nor did they advertise our Herman Miller chairs we purchased as seconds.  The many Aeron chairs we bought from Madison.Seating were actually substandard based on input from Herman Miller.  Herman Miller told us that we needed to deal directly with Madison.Seating, our supplier, since we did not order directly from Herman Miller or an official outlet.  HM told us that the chairs they sold to Madison.Seating were substandard, basically seconds, and they were rid of them by selling them to Madison.  (Actually, that was quite sneaky of HM to sell off seconds to a low class Amazon seller, as well!  Shame on you Herman Miller!)  So after spending thousands of dollars on at least 5 or 6 Aeron chairs from Madison.Seating, they won't help us at all with the broken seat.  If I had known that the 10yr warranty would not be backed, I would not have purchased these chairs from Madison.Seating.  Be aware of your Herman Miller purchases from other sellers that are not direct distributors of Herman Miller.  Read the seller's warranty in full.  If your chair arrives without a sticker on the bottom with codes for reference when you need to call and order parts for repair, you have a \"second\" on your hands.\n",

Based on weight, I need a size C.  I decided to get the open box Aeron and use it as impetus to lose weight.  PEOPLE! DOES THAT EVER WORK?!

The assembly wasn't a big deal, but I had made the decision to buy this chair over others  based on the \"Posture Fit\" feature. The chair, otherwise, was as described and delivered quickly and in good condition. I wrote Customer Service and received a prompt reply. Customer Service indicated that I should have known from the title and the pictures that the Posture Fit wasn't included. From my perspective, since Posture Fit is a lumbar support feature and the picture to me showed nothing specific about the lumbar feature, I humbly disagree. Had the description been accurate, matching what was delivered, I might still have purchased the chair. But my buying experience went from \"Awesome Value\" to \"Disappointing Experience\".

To my fellow Gaming PC builders--why spend 2k on a high end rig and then 100 bucks on a chair?  Invest in a good chair.Actually Buying It - Originally went to DWR and sat down in a bunch of these chairs to get a feel for em.  DWR helped me out by letting me test em so I decided to order through them.  It would take 3-4 weeks for me to get my chair--are you serious?  Nevertheless I still went with them--but after they missed a shipping deadline which would have delayed my order more--I cancelled my order as it hadn't shipped.  Ordered it on Amazon and had it within 2 days.Comfort - Already plenty of reviews explaining how to sit and use it--but here's my take--the chair itself--I can't even tell it's working.  I used to have backpain with my older chairs and they are a thing of the past.  The arm rests are good enough to where they don't wear down and hurt my elbows.  My one complaint is that when sitting indian style, the hard plastic material to the front of the chair hurts my feet.  Other than that--it's a solid chair. I'm studying for my MCAT right now and sit for 8-10 hours a day and feel no back pain.Cheers!\n",

Well since then i've started my own company and was looking for an office chair that wouldn't interfere with long development hours. I can say without a doubt the Aeron chair has lived up to its name and history. The build quality, adjustability and materials are awesome. I've been able to sit for much longer during a day without leg and back pain. I opted for the highly adjustable version and am sure glad I did. The ability to fine tune the settings for the perfect fit is in actuality priceless.I realize the chair is most definitely pricey ($800+ for the decked out version) but if you work for a living sitting you owe your body a comfortable seat. Not to mention you'll be happier later on down the road as the chair will easily last 10+ years if taken care of properly. The cost will likely be spent over time on inferior chairs so look at the long term in this case. Don't blindly buy a size/model though, do your research on what would work best for your use case. You can even call Herman Miller and ask specifics based on weight, height, office style and a myriad of other specifics.I purchased mine here on Amazon through OfficeDesigns, highly recommend them as well.UPDATE: The chair is on a holiday sale, almost $100 off the already low price.\n",

It rides up in the tracks, eventually coming off the top of them if I neglect to push it back down for a couple days.  Assumed it was defective, so I called Herman Miller.  They told me to contact the vendor, which I did and was sent a replacement.  However, the new one works no better than the original.  I'm 6' 1\", 220 lbs, so I don't think it's a case of me being too big for the C size Aeron.The minor annoyance is the arms.  They pivot horizontally at the back end, I suppose to accommodate larger or smaller people.  Problem is, while they have detents to hold them at several positions, they don't lock, so every time I go to get up, at least one of them swings outward.\n",

I certainly hope that this isn't the way HM ships these and it was just the reseller, because it was TERRIBLE. The \"box\" is put together with scraps of cardboard taped together.

        "content": "\nI had been mulling over buying one of these chairs for years. The price has always just been too high. I couldn't justify to myself, after I added all those features like adjustable armrest positions, and tilt, and stuff. It came out to nearly 1000 dollars on Herman Millers website. These guys had the fully loaded one ready to go for so much cheaper, I thought it was too good to be true. I read the one other review from these guys, worried that almost nobody has purchased this thing from them. I figured... I could always get my money back if it was a bust, so give it a try. I was no dissapointed! This arrived and was super simple to setup. Just had to screw the backrest into the seat, 4 screws, and it was ready for sitting. It's in perfect condition, works amazingly well, even has the leather armrests which is very fancy. Buy this chair, you won't regret it, I work at a computer for 8-12 hours a day, and nothing compares. And these guys make it finally affordable for the version you want!\n",

        "content": "\nAfter having it for a few months, I wanted to do a quick write-up.The chair itself seems ok. It looked great out of the box, no major issues seen on the outset. After some time, I noticed the armrests were uneven when they were all the way up or down. I checked out the source of the unevenness, and the part that they fasten to - which is a major structural part of the chair and is what you attach the backrest and seat to - were not sitting evenly. One had a lot more \"play\" than the other, so I started taking things apart and was finding that most of the larger parts all seemed to be genuine Herman Miller parts, but they had taken some liberties with refurbishing the chair.That's what this chair seems to be in my case, refurbished, not \"open box\", which is a staggering difference in expectation.I don't have any Herman Miller experience, but in the few hours I've been working on my issues with the chair, I've found that there are definitely some problems with the product they sold me which I had not picked up on outside of the 30-day window and I may keep the chair and just buy some parts and fix it up.\n",

I really wanted a chair like the one at the office. Well, thanks to Madison Seating, I have one, fully loaded, with lumbar support and adjustable arm height, for a fraction of what a new HM Aeron typically goes for.I received it in 2 days, too, which I consider a bit of luck. All I had to 'assemble' was the chair back, which requires tightening four Allen bolts (Allen wrench included). It's really really great and I could not be more pleased with this purchase. Best decision I could have made, after years of bad, cheap home office chairs. Thanks, Madison Seating, you have a new fan!\n",

I have an adjustable height desk but some recent problems have me staying off my feet as much as possible for a few months.  So, I decided to spend some money on a better chair.  The chair I was previously using was an old solid wood office chair with no padding and very limited adjustability.  After searching around and shopping at a few office furniture stores I decided on the Aeron.The difference between the Aeron and other chairs I have used is very noticeable.  It is beyond comfortable and helps me to improve my posture by making it more comfortable to sit straight up vs leaning forward on my desk while typing.  Yes, it is expensive.  But, with the warranty and features it offers is definitely worth it.Even the box it is shipped in is impressive.  A corrugated box that is so strong (and heavy) you would think it is a wooden crate.  My chair arrived in absolutely perfect condition.\n",

Found a two-minute video on YouTube on how to assemble the chair from opening the carton to attaching the seat back with four easy bolts an the Allen wrench provided.  Could not be easier.I would recommend this chair to anyone.  It will last decades, without degradation in comfort, support or the various adjustments and mechanisms, all covered by a 12-year warranty.Considering a lesser cost chair will only hold its quality fo a couple of yeas, this chair will pay for itself in six to eight years.

The chair was sent out immediately and arrived within a week. Everything arrived in perfect condition and was easy to setup.

There are a few scuffs on the chair back, but otherwise the chair is in excellent condition. It almost looks new. You will need a 5 mm Allen wrench (not provided) to screw in the four bolts that attach the chair back to the chair (3/16\" will also work), so it's basically no assembly.

I've reached out to Herman Miller customer service and Madison Seating customer service (they are the ones I purchased this from) - both have told me I can pay money to buy the armrest and provide no other solution.

The arm rests are my biggest complaint. For some reason they are made to pivot inward or outward, but I find this \"feature\" completely useless. I'd rather they be able to slide in or out rather than just pivot. You can't lock them to prevent them from pivoting, so they often get bumped into positions I don't want them in. Very annoying. And overall the chair just is not all that comfortable for me. Mesh really can never replace a good cushion, no matter how high quality the mesh is. My other complaint is how needlessly heavy this chair is. The base is solid steel, but what advantage does this really have? The chair is not any more solid than other more affordable chairs I've used. This chair still creeks and pops and wobbles like any other desk chair I've used. In my opinion your money is better spent on something else.\n",

The lumbar support is super easy to adjust, and unlike so many comfy chairs, it breathes so it is never hot sitting in it for long periods.  One of the chairs we ordered came with a defective caster.  Within just a few hours I received an email from the distributor apologizing for the inconvenience, and a few days later, I received TWO replacements.  THANK YOU!  Very happy to give both the chair and the company a gold star.\n",

I don't feel physically fatigued in my muscles the way that I used to after an 8 hour day at work. I believe these chairs are worth the money and I am enjoying mine immensely. The quality appears to match the price point in looks as well as function and, so far, delivers all that is promised. Great chair!\n",

The lumbar support is easy to adjust, as is tilt, arm height, and seat height. Size B is the regular sized version. If you are tall or over 275 pounds, I recommend the larger version. It arrives preassembled. Just unscrew 4 screws using a 3/16\" allen wrench, slide on the back, and put the screws back in. The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.\n",

The chairs look brand new! One had a caster damaged in shipping, but I'm not going to worry about it. It works fine and it's in one of the back rooms, so no one will see it. Thank you for providing such a wonderful product at about half price!!\n",

I bought this hoping that a more adjustable chair would help ease my chronic neck/shoulder/upper back pain. Well, it didn't help at all. Yes, it's a quality chair. But $1,000? No. I returned it as the $150 chair was just as painful to sit in as this one.\n",

He really enjoys the lumbar support the chair offers. The lumbar support piece is adjustable depending on your comfort level, it can also be removed if you do not like. The armrests are also adjustable, either upwards/downward or inwards/outwards. So overall this chair was made for a variety of comforts.\n",

I can sit in this chair working for 12 hours without feeling terribly uncomfortable like I would in a normal office chair (my last chair was a Steelcase). It was also good for me because I'm tall (6'4\") and normal office chairs aren't able to offer the adjustment options that the Aeron Chair offers. I think without this chair, I would definitely have carpal tunnel by now because of how awkward other chairs were.\n",

        "content": "\nI am very disappointed with this chair. It's neither comfortable (it's unyielding and pokes in all the wrong places) nor orthopedic (it gives me back ache). The seat is hard, and because it's not properly contoured at the front it cuts off the circulation in my legs. An added 2-inch thick seat cushion helps with that but puts the lumbar contour in the wrong place. The lever that controls how far back the chair tilts doesn't work properly - to get the desired degree of tilt requires repeated hit and miss attempts to get close. It's very heavy, which would be worth the inconvenience if it was a comfortable and healthy chair, but it's not. The chair that it replaced, which cost less than $200, was not perfect but it was far more comfortable and healthier for my back than this one.\n",
